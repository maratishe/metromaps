This project is for METRO MAPS, which are an alternative to traditional ontologies. 

Practice shows that ontologies are hard on many facets, including annotation of content and human browsing of ontologies.  Humans are having hard time making sense of ontologies which are not generated with practical needs in mind -- ontologies are more like a rigid standard, same for everyone. 

Metromaps allow for improved flexibility and practicality of use.  Tagging is still used but tags are not joined by rigid ontologies.  Instead, they are connected by users using train lines and, as a bigger unit, metormaps. 

This code is based on a simple example based on my own practice.  I keep track of all the scientific papers I read.  I tag them.  But I do not generate ontologies.  Instead, trains are mentions in tags.  Since I know all my trains -- my personal metromap is not that big compared to a small-size ontology -- it is easy to process such content.

Metromaps are pleasing to the eye.  See PDFs to some examples.  Otherwise, see how scripts use *graphviz* library to generate them.  I only use a subset of available functionality.  *Graphviz* can do a lot more. 

Will keep improving the method.
